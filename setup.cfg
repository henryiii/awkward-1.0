# E712 should be dropped, False/True should compared by "is" or checked as booleans, but not "=="
# E711 should be dropped, always compare None with is, not ==.
# F841 should be removed, use nothing or _ or _<name> for an unused variable
# E402 can be improved in the future with isort
# F403 should be removed, import * is evil
# B007 should be removed, variables that are not used should start with _
